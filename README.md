##### Combining multiple GraphQL APIs into one

- One of the main benefits of GraphQL is that we can query all of our data as part of one schema, and get everything we need in one request. But as the schema grows, it might become cumbersome to manage it all as one codebase, and it starts to make sense to split it into different modules. We may also want to decompose your schema into separate microservices, which can be developed and deployed independently.

- In both cases, we use mergeSchemas to combine multiple GraphQL schemas together and produce a merged schema that knows how to delegate parts of the query to the relevant subschemas. These subschemas can be either local to the server, or running on a remote server. They can even be services offered by 3rd parties, allowing us to connect to external data and create mashups.
